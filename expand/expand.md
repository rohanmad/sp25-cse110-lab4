1. Asynchronous Nature: JavaScript often has to deal with events happening at unpredictable times (like a user clicking, or a server responding late), which makes the code more complex, because processes can't always be run sequentially. Loose Typing: While this can be convienient, it can also create a lot of bugs, as the JavaScript won't catch the errors early, and will only occur when the program is up and running. Web Platform: Sometimes browsers implement features differently, causing inconsistencies when a script works in one browser but not another.
2. JavaScript was created loosely typed so websites could run easier, and keep running if issues came up. This way, even if it runs unexpectedly, the entire website won't just crash and shut down.
